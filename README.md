# bauherrengemeinschaft
Aspirational blueprint to co-develop a family-focused apartment building with friends in Canada, inspired by the bauherrengemeinschaft buildings in Germany. AKA Baugruppen.

## Forward
This is an aspirational blueprint / guide to develop family-friendly housing created by and for end-users/friends to live in. 

This idea is inspired by the [developments](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauherrengemeinschaft) in Germany.

As well as the efforts of [fans](https://www.larchlab.com/baugruppen/) to bring the concept to North America.

This guide breaks down the creation of these projects into components and discusses their challenges, solutions, how-tos and intricacies so that you can make your own __Canadian Dream Â©__

## So you would like to make a bauherrengemeinschaft, eh?

Since there are currently no easy mechanisms or examples of completed bauherrengemeinschaft in Canada, there is a lot we don't know about how to make them. Hopefully this guide will be a helping hand on your guide to make your vision come to life. In order to develop something like this, you will need to wear many hats and learn in many different directions - but it's dangerous to go alone, split up the learning between friends to specialize in areas that you're most interested in. And if you come across relevant information on your journey that you didn't find on this guide, please get in touch and let us know!
