# bauherrengemeinschaft
Aspirational blueprint to co-develop a family-focused apartment building with friends in Canada, inspired by the bauherrengemeinschaft buildings in Germany. AKA Baugruppen.

## Forward
The main idea here is to provide a guidebook to develop family-friendly housing created by and for end-users/friends to live in. 

This idea is inspired by the [developments](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauherrengemeinschaft) in Germany.

As well as the efforts of [fans](https://www.larchlab.com/baugruppen/) to bring the concept to North America.

This guide breaks down the creation of these projects into components and discusses their challenges, solutions, how-tos and intricacies so that you can make your own __Canadian Dream Â©__
